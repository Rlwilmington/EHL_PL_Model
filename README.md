#Notes on Git and Github for MATLAB 2019b on Windows 10

1) Installed Git for Windows
2) Installed CYGWIN (no clear effect? Added path to librarypath.txt file as instructed on https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/set-up-git-source-control.html#use_ssh_authentication)
3) Created Github public repo
4) Attempted SSH authentication, created SSH key in Git Bash (no luck with ssh-keygen in MATLAB), added key to Github, made text file with key info
5) Added HOME environmental var, using Windows 10 Env Vars settings
6) Auth failed, reverted back to HTTPS authentication. Added credentials in Git Bash, not sure if working yet (https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/caching-your-github-password-in-git)
7) Practice with MATLAB Git Source Control interface (https://blogs.mathworks.com/community/2014/10/20/matlab-and-git/)
8) Syntax for Git Bash
    pwd - print working directory
    cd /c/project/ - change directory
    Tab to see available paths, note spaces are marked with indents and slashes may be reversed
